![\\ Bei Dao](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d2ef4f52-c7d3-418a-b7f1-75b8bda9224c.jpg)

> _Debasement is the password of the base,  
> Nobility the epitaph of the noble.  
> See how the gilded sky is covered  
> With the drifting twisted shadows of the dead.  
> The Ice Age is over now,  
> Why is there ice everywhere?  
> The Cape of Good Hope has been discovered,  
> Why do a thousand sails contest the Dead Sea?  
> I came into this world  
> Bringing only paper, rope, a shadow,  
> To proclaim before the judgment  
> The voice that has been judged:  
> Let me tell you, world,  
> I---do---not---believe!  
> If a thousand challengers lie beneath your feet,  
> Count me as number thousand and one.  
> I don't believe the sky is blue;  
> I don't believe in thunder's echoes;  
> I don't believe that dreams are false;  
> I don't believe that death has no revenge.  
> If the sea is destined to breach the dikes  
> Let all the brackish water pour into my heart;  
> If the land is destined to rise  
> Let humanity choose a peak for existence again.  
> A new conjunction and glimmering stars  
> Adorn the unobstructed sky now;  
> They are the pictographs from five thousand years.  
> They are the watchful eyes of future generations."_
